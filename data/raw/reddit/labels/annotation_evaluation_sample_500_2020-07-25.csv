Cons: Tons of rednecks and white trash. Awful job market/ low wages. Weather is either freezing cold or unbearably hot and humid, we get maybe 3 months of the year where weather is comfortable. Not much variety of food/restaurants (good luck finding Thai food or good sushi around here).

Pros: Scenery is gorgeous. Lots of mountains and rivers for outdoor activities. Loads of back roads to explore. Lots of state parks and places to camp on the weekend. Low cost of living. Lots of townie bars with dirt cheap booze.

My teacher at the time knew how much I loved these two books and how much I loved reading in general and sent me home with The Hobbit. I fell in love with it. The summer after fifth grade, I got the LotR trilogy and read them as quickly as possible. 

I didn't know there were any more than that for a long time, though. I was a Sophomore in high school when I found out The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, or any other books about Middle Earth existed. I had picked up a Tolkien Bestiary and saw all of these unfamiliar titles cited. I still haven't read Children of Huren and some of the histories and I'm now 25.

Few major observations:
- your elections are bankrolled by candidates
- separation between president and congress in terms of political power is significant and yet all the attention is on the POTUS to get all the work done.
- lobbying (in Australia political donations of like over 10 or 11 thousand have to be disclosed).
- what in the actual fuck is civil forfeiture and who let that happen 
- healthcare pls 
- why so many guns

On the plus side I think America is one of the most patriotic 1st world countries (that im familiar with) and there sense of national pride is impressive. In Australia we tend to not give a fuck about much.. ",<australia>,,,,,Australia,Oceania,1,country,country,,,,,,,

Chazzyphant,e8aoq3i,t3_9qla9e,comments,femalefashionadvice,"I'm in Denver, and most people consider this the ""Midwest"", although some say West or Southwest. I see a few different typical fashions: 

1: athleisure is huge, especially in a higher income bracket. Spending the day hiking, biking, working out, or other outdoor sports and then going to brunch wearing sports gear is not seen as a faux pas here. Your toned and sporty bod IS your biggest accessory and swag. 

2: I also see ""hipster"" type wear with a focus on a rugged, ""blue collar"" vintage look (shearling lined denim jackets, bandannas, engineer boots, coveralls as an outfit, [these](https://i.imgur.com/0EAvR9p.jpg) boots, little or no makeup and very natural hair with a bright lip) or true 50s and 60s beatnik and rockabilly looks. Very little 70s, 80s or punk/goth. I just saw almost 2000 hipsters at an event on Sunday so I got to see a HUGE amount of 20 something and early 30 something fashion! 

3: The third category I see would be kind of...typical everyday not fashionable but not unfashionable stuff. Jeans with a tee or blouse and cardigan. A printed top and black slacks and ballet flats. A dress with sandals---but nothing really ""done"", ya know? Definitely more on the casual ""Target basics"" end of things. 

I don't stick out per se, but I rarely see people dressed like me here! ",<denver>,Denver,,Denver County,Colorado,United States,North America,1,city,city,,,,,,,

jkaska,c0spta7,t3_chwck,comments,vegan,"cape town south africa!

Advantages: Loads of fresh veg and fruit, readily available, lots of restaurants have vegan items or will willingly veganise something for you, stores stock legumes, grains etc and two varieties of locally produced ""fake meat"" (the one is awesome, the other inedible), tofu, humus etc. We have a great vegan society and more and more specialist restautants / cafes / stores. 

Difficulties: culture - south africans love their meat, and a braai (bbq) and love ostracising veggies. There are only two brands of vegan cheeses and both are imported and thus very expensive, not env friendly etc. 

EDIT: I find it super easy to be vegan. I don't find it ""hard"" really anywhere... but then if I am in the middle of nowhere I lower my expectations and will settle for a peanutbutter sandwitch etc","<cape town, south africa>",Cape Town,,Cape Town,Western Cape,South Africa,Africa,1,city,city,,,,,,,

I have multiple names and they're a bit of a bother because I have to write them all down on every document. Also, since people here seem to have trouble with the concept of mdidle names, they assume they can just call me by any of the names I have rather than by the one I use. With my birth name, I had a middle name that was very easy to pronounce for Italians, as opposed to my first name which was foreign, and I had a lot of teachers assume they could just call me by my middle name which I hated.

Pros: The town itself is quite liberal, there's a decent university and so there are a lot of younger people, the summers are really gorgeous and usually in the mid-80s, we're totally surrounded by mountains, the Great Sand Dunes are close, there are tons of outdoor activities, housing is much cheaper than most of Colorado, lots of great authentic Mexican food, a decent job market.

Cons: Some of the surrounding towns are quite conservative and excessively religious (there is a large Mormon community and there is a lot of nepotism), it's in the middle of absolutely nowhere so if you want to go to a large store besides Walmart you have to drive 2.5+ hours, the winters can be absolutely brutal - we have been named the coldest area in the contiguous US before, because housing is cheaper pay is also lower and jobs with upward mobility can be hard to find because people never quit, it's such a small town that there is almost no anonymity.

HeadingtoFall,dcwck4f,t3_5q4upc,comments,cscareerquestions,"just to be fair, I'll start. hopefully this takes off.

I'm in Santa Barbara, CA. The job market isn't that bad for a small town, lots of defense contractors, along with some other smaller or growing tech companies. I feel I wouldn't have too much difficulty getting another job in the area, but if you don't live nearby they don't seem like the type to fly people out here for interviews or pay relocation. The biggest name around I guess would be Sonos.

It's not San Francisco pricey by any means, but it can get expensive, especially studios which I'd average to around $1500 I guess. And the quality of most of them seems pretty low. There's a lot of run down apartments designed for the large local student population though if you don't mind cockroaches and lack of amenities. Good luck if you want to try to buy a house here.

The town itself is not bad, it's right on the beach and the weather is fantastic nearly year round. There are pretty decent options nearby for outdoor activities. On the other hand, there are no good food options, and it is a town, not a city. It's only a couple of hours to LA, but the town itself isn't very lively, with a large student population and a large older population, but not a lot in between. A lot of people around here feel like the stereotypical somewhat superficial rich white people with their yoga and pilates and whatever fad diets (gluten free) are popular, if you're into that.","<san francisco>; <santa barbara, california>",,,,California,United States,North America,1,city,state,Santa Barbara,,,California,United States,North America,multiple_locations
